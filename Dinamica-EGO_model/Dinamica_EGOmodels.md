<h2 align="center">Dinamica EGO Models</h2>

    This page contains the core scripts used throughout the spatial land-use and land-cover (LULC) simulation workflow of the project. These scripts form the methodological backbone of the modeling framework implemented in Dinamica EGO.

    The scripts were consistently applied to all simulated regions. While input datasets and spatial constraints may vary by region, the modeling logic, transition structure, and simulation procedures remain the same.
